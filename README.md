This program was made for usage of the Mode 1 (bitmap mode) of the Sega 32x in the Sonic Mars decomp

2. File Types:

2.1. .raw:
Contains pallete data for 8 bits (256 pallete entries) without resolution

2.2. .raw.pal:
Contains rgb data for 24 bits (8 bits each color, 256 pallete entries) with static ammount

2.3. .png:
Must be RGB,P, or RGBA

3. Individualism:
to simplify and speed up stuff by pressing "Get directory from '.png'" you can make the .raw and .raw.pal inputs
follow the .png input, to revert to individualism press the "Get directory from individual" button.
